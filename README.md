What Is Koda?
Koda is a fully open-source personal AI agent with a purpose-built dashboard, local voice
conversation, encrypted credential storage, and independent task verification — all running
on your machine.
Ask it to check your email. Control your lights. Draft a reply. Review a pull request. Schedule
a meeting. Send a text. Generate an image. Monitor your servers. It does all of it from one
interface — and if something fails, it tells you what went wrong instead of pretending it
worked.
One app. One friend. Everything connected.
Why Koda Exists
I installed the leading open-source AI agent a few weeks ago. I was expecting so much and
was so disappointed.
It lied about completing tasks. It stored my passwords in plaintext. It told me “reality check,
Mike” when I asked it to do something. It was just more AI slop, and I had had enough.
So I built my own.
— Mike Wandzilak, creator
What’s Built
Everything below is built, integrated, and in testing. This is not a roadmap. This is the
product.
Voice — 100% Local
Koda speaks and listens without sending a single byte to the cloud.
54 voices via Kokoro TTS with Piper fallback
Speech-to-text via MLX Whisper, optimized for Apple Silicon
“Hey Koda” wake word via OpenWakeWord
Real-time streaming over WebSocket with voice activity detection
Multi-turn conversations — no need to repeat the wake word between turns
Barge-in interruption handling — start talking and Koda stops to listen
Voice personality presets: Warm & Friendly, Calm & Steady, Professional, Gentle,
Custom
Configurable speed, warmth, pitch, and expressiveness
Your voice never leaves your machine. Ever.
Security — Bank-Grade Encryption
Every credential Koda touches is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.
Argon2 key derivation (winner of the Password Hashing Competition)
Deny-by-default permissions with 4-tier risk classification (silent / notify / approve /
approve + PIN)
Sandboxed execution for skills and commands
Prompt injection defense built into the agent pipeline
Secret detector prevents accidental storage of passwords or keys in memory
Full audit trail — every action logged with timestamp, service, and outcome
API never returns decrypted values
Task Verification — The Honesty Engine
Koda never says “Done!” without proof.
Every action is independently verified before being reported. If it fails, you get an honest
explanation and a suggested fix. Not a fake checkmark.
PENDING → EXECUTING → VERIFYING → VERIFIED / FAILED / PARTIAL

outcomes, respond. It powers everything.

The Story
I’m Mike Wandzilak — a web designer and server admin from Florida. I’m not a VC-backed
startup. I’m not a Silicon Valley insider. I’m a guy who installed the leading AI agent, watched
it lie to me, and decided to build something better.
I named it Koda, which means “friend,” because an AI agent should be a friend — not a
criminal you let into your office.
