## What Is Koda?

Koda is a fully open-source personal AI agent with a purpose-built dashboard, local voice conversation, encrypted credential storage, and independent task verification — all running on your machine.

Ask it to check your email. Control your lights. Draft a reply. Review a pull request. Schedule a meeting. Send a text. Generate an image. Monitor your servers. It does all of it from one interface — and if something fails, it tells you what went wrong instead of pretending it worked.

What makes Koda unlike anything else: **she can upgrade herself.** Ask her to add a capability she doesn't have, and she'll read her own source code, write a new tool module, test it, register it at runtime, and use it — all in the same conversation. Connect a USB camera and tell her it's there; she'll code her own vision module.

One app. One friend. Everything connected. Always evolving.

## Why Koda Exists

I installed the leading open-source AI agent a few weeks ago. I was expecting so much and was so disappointed.

It lied about completing tasks. It stored my passwords in plaintext. It told me "reality check, Mike" when I asked it to do something. It was just more AI slop, and I had had enough.

So I built my own.

— **Mike Wandzilak**, creator

## What's Built

Everything below is built, integrated, and in testing. This is not a roadmap. This is the product.

### 🎤 Voice — 100% Local

Koda speaks and listens without sending a single byte to the cloud.

- **54 voices** via Kokoro TTS with Piper fallback
- **Speech-to-text** via MLX Whisper, optimized for Apple Silicon
- **"Hey Koda" wake word** via OpenWakeWord
- **Real-time streaming** over WebSocket with voice activity detection
- Multi-turn conversations — no need to repeat the wake word between turns
- Barge-in interruption handling — start talking and Koda stops to listen
- Voice personality presets: Warm & Friendly, Calm & Steady, Professional, Gentle, Custom
- Configurable speed, warmth, pitch, and expressiveness

Your voice never leaves your machine. Ever.

### 🔐 Security — Bank-Grade Encryption

Every credential Koda touches is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.

- Argon2 key derivation (winner of the Password Hashing Competition)
- Deny-by-default permissions with 4-tier risk classification (silent / notify / approve / approve + PIN)
- Sandboxed execution for skills and commands
- Prompt injection defense built into the agent pipeline
- Secret detector prevents accidental storage of passwords or keys in memory
- Full audit trail — every action logged with timestamp, service, and outcome
- API never returns decrypted values

### ✅ Task Verification — The Honesty Engine

Koda never says "Done!" without proof.

Every action is independently verified before being reported. If it fails, you get an honest explanation and a suggested fix. Not a fake checkmark.

`PENDING → EXECUTING → VERIFYING → VERIFIED / FAILED / PARTIAL`

### 🧠 The Brain

The agent orchestrator is the core loop — receive message, think, call tools, verify outcomes, respond. It powers everything.

- 83+ tools registered across all modules
- Quality gate strips robotic phrases and AI-isms
- Voice-aware responses (shorter sentences, contractions when speaking)
- Correction tracker learns from your feedback
- Runtime-switchable between Anthropic Claude and OpenAI GPT
- Multi-model routing: simple tasks → fast cheap models, complex tasks → powerful models
- Budget-aware with per-user spending limits

### 📧 Email

Multi-account email with IMAP/SMTP. Auto-detects settings for Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud, Zoho, FastMail, and more.

- Read, summarize, draft, send, and manage across accounts
- Smart classification: priority, category, and action type
- Follow-up tracking and inbox summarization
- Three permission levels: Read Only, Read + Draft, Full Access

### 📅 Calendar

CalDAV support for Apple Calendar, Nextcloud, Fastmail, and 6+ providers.

- Multi-calendar unified view with conflict detection
- Smart scheduling: "Find me 30 minutes this week to meet Sarah"
- Daily briefings with meeting prep context

### 📱 SMS

Twilio-powered text messaging with a full conversation interface.

- Send and receive texts from the dashboard
- Conversation threading by contact
- Alert rules with cooldown — server goes down, Koda texts you
- Scheduled messages and morning briefing integration

### 🏠 Smart Home

Govee direct API + Home Assistant for 2,000+ device types.

- 6 built-in scenes: Movie Mode, Bedtime, Good Morning, Work Mode, Relax, Party
- Voice-triggered: "Hey Koda, movie time" → lights dim, locks engage
- Individual device control: brightness, color, temperature, locks, covers, media
- 9 agent tools for natural language control

### 🤖 Multi-Agent System

Koda manages a team of specialized AI workers.

- 6 agent types: Researcher, Analyst, Writer, Developer, Strategist, Specialist
- Task assignment with status tracking and per-agent budgets
- All communication flows through Koda — no unsupervised agent-to-agent chatter
- Agent lifecycle: Create → Active → Idle → Sleep → Wake → Retire

### 🧬 Self-Evolution Engine

Koda's most unique capability — she can read, modify, and extend her own codebase at runtime.

- **Terminal Access** — Full shell execution with output capture, timeout protection, and dangerous command blocking
- **Code Introspection** — Read any of her own source modules, explore her codebase structure
- **Self-Modification** — Write new tool modules or modify existing ones, with automatic backup and syntax validation before every write
- **Runtime Registration** — Hot-load new tools without restarting. Create a capability and use it in the same conversation
- **Auto-Restart** — Trigger uvicorn reload for deep changes (frontend auto-reconnects)
- **Hardware Integration** — Detect connected USB devices, webcams, and audio hardware. Install Python packages on the fly. Write her own integration code for new peripherals
- **Safety Guardrails** — All code paths validated to stay within the source directory. CRITICAL risk tier on writes and restarts requires explicit user approval. Automatic backups before every modification. Protected module warnings for core files

*Example: "Hey Koda, I plugged in a USB camera. Can you use it?"* → Koda detects the hardware, reads her own code patterns, writes an OpenCV-based camera tool, installs the dependency, registers the tool, and captures an image — all autonomously.

### 🎯 Command Center

Manage sessions on other AI platforms from one dashboard.

- Claude.ai automation via Playwright (ChatGPT and Gemini architecture ready)
- Three modes: Autopilot, Co-pilot, Monitor-only
- Chrome extension bridge for enhanced browser control
- Multi-account Claude Max management with load balancing

### ⚡ Workflows

DAG-based automation with branching logic and human-in-the-loop approval.

- Multi-step workflows triggered manually, on schedule, or by events
- Conditional branching, per-step error handling, pause/resume
- Full run history with step-by-step audit

### 🧠 Memory

Koda remembers what matters and forgets what it shouldn't.

- 4 tiers: Short-term (24h), Medium-term (30 days), Long-term (permanent), Episodic
- Categories: Preferences, Projects, Contacts, Tasks, Patterns
- Secret detector blocks accidental storage of passwords and API keys
- Privacy controls per category with full "right to be forgotten" wipe

### 🔌 50+ Integrations

YAML-based plugin system — add new services without touching core code.

- 6 plugins shipped: Govee, Home Assistant, Stripe, Spotify, Weather, Slack
- Service catalog across 11 categories
- Webhook system with HMAC validation and retry logic
- Custom REST API connector for anything with a URL

### 🎨 AI Content Studio

## The Story

I'm Mike Wandzilak — a web designer and server admin from Florida. I'm not a VC-backed startup. I'm not a Silicon Valley insider. I'm a guy who installed the leading AI agent, watched it lie to me, and decided to build something better.

I named it Koda, which means "friend," because an AI agent should be a friend — not a criminal you let into your office.
